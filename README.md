# Sun Spotter
This is a simple Andriod App that allows the user to enter their zip code or city name and hit a "Search" button. Beneath the form is a View that shows whether there is going to be any sun in the next few days, and if so when that first sun will be. There is als a scrollable list of the tri-hourly forecast for the next few days, emphasizing whether there is sun or not.

The user stories for the Sun Spotter app are:

* As a user, I want to specify my location so I can see if there will be sunshine near me.
* As a user, I want to see if and when there will be any sun in the near future.
* As a user, I want to see a future weather forecast so I can plan to spend time in the sun.

It looks something like this:
